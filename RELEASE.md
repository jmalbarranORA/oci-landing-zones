## v2.1.0 - 2023-06-05
- Initial Release of Workload Expansion Stack. The Workload Expansion template is responsible for deploying the resources for an empty workload. The user can use the workload expansion stack to deploy additional customized workload.
  Workload Expansion template will deploy the following resources:
  - Compartment
  - Network (Spoke)
  - Logging
  - Monitoring
  - Policies and workload group
- Refactoring Network module. The network module was refactored to the Hub module and the Spoke module. The Hub module deploys the main network resource using for baseline stack and the spoke module deploys resource using for workload stack.

## v2.0.0 - 2023-02-28
- Initial Release of new version 2 codebase with Hub and Spoke Networking, Multi-Environment support and more modular architecture. see the [Architecture Guide](./templates/enterprise-landing-zone/Architecture_Guide.md) for details.
- CIS Security Benchmark Compliance: Oracle Enterprise Landing Zone v2 was designed to include a foundational set of security controls from the Center for Internet Security (CIS). We are happy to share that this release of Landing Zones will support the recommended CIS 1.2 Level 1 controls. The security controls implemented by this Landing Zone are prescriptive and practical in nature with the primary focus to help provide best practices for security hardening of the technologies that are deployed in our customers' tenancies.
While many of the CIS Level 1 recommendations are included in the Landing Zone deployment, however, there are some that require administrators to configure manually. Please be advised that for recommendations # 1.5 - 1.13, 2.6 - 2.8 and 3.16, it will be the customer administrators' responsibility to implement and enforce.
For recommendation #1.7, we recommend that Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) be fully tested before restricting access only to MFA-verified users. Please note each user must enable MFA for themselves and an administrator cannot enable MFA for another user. For more information, please see [OCI Managing Multi-Factor Authentication documentation][v2.0.0-1].
For more information on the CIS Security Benchmark, please visit the official [Oracle Cloud CIS Benchmark site][v2.0.0-2].
- Certain CIDR ranges should not be used when deploying OELZv2, as the can conflict with IP addresses reserved for special use. These are:
    * 169.254.10.0-169.254.19.255
    * 169.254.100.0-169.254.109.255
    * 169.254.192.0-169.254.201.255
    * 100.64.0.0â€“100.127.255.255 (Used by Exadata X8M/X9M for the interconnect)
- Known Issues
  * 400-InvalidParameter Error in CreateServiceConnector operation:  This can occasionally happen due to logs taking longer than normal to create while setting up the logging infrastructure.  This will correct itself when the logs finish creating. Later Apply jobs in ORM or invocations of `terraform apply` should succeed.
  * 429-TooManyRequests Error: A tenancy making a large number of OCI API requests in rapid succession may be throttled by the API.  The solution is to wait some period of time (a few minutes) and retry the terraform operation again.  This is rarely seen on `apply` but may occasionally be seen on `destroy` runs, as the delete operations are much faster than create, and Terraform makes many API calls.
